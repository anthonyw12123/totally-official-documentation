# totally-official-documentation
All of the technical writing I've done is behind NDAs and corporate portals, but I've done a lot of it, so this is technical documentation on public things, so my style can be perused.

## What You'll Find
In this project, you'll find various kinds of technical documentation relevant to different sources, and you'll see why changes are made along the way. This is useful for a few reasons:
* Technical documentation has many different specific purposes, and this is a great place to exemplify them all, over time.
* I think technical documentation isn't useful if it isn't accessible, and you'll see my understanding of accessiblity as it evolves over time.
* I also think technical documentation needs to be thorough. Likewise, the definition of thorough may change over time.
That said, here is where you'll find all of the ideas.

## How You'll Find it
This repository is designed in a top-down fashion, with admittedly a tongue-in-cheek style befitting the nature of the project. Different sections are devoted to the different facets that technical documentation can be interpreted as.

## Future Goals
It immediately occurs to me that the open source world might have some immediate candidates that could benefit from Documentation Santa, but I don't know them yet. I'd like to have sections devoted to flow processes, very niche things, disaster recovery procedures, scope documents, statements of work, instruction manuals, FAQs, and other specific forms as they develop.
There's also a case for using different technologies for documentation, as I understand it. At the time of this writing, I have expereince with the MSOffice space, Confluence, markdown, and LaTeX (for more academic works). 

## Feedback
It makes sense to me that this docuemntation base would benefit from interaction with a real client. At this time, please raise an issue with the repository for feedback, and we'll handle it as it comes.
